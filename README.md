ZEKO is a modern personal safety app designed for both men and women, combining smart technology with an easy-to-use, elegant interface. The app begins by collecting gender and phone number, then verifies the user via SMS.

Users set up to three emergency contacts, with a mandatory contact based on gender — the SHE Team for women, police for men. Once authenticated, the user enters the homepage, which displays a greeting, a red SOS button, and their live location on a map.

Pressing the SOS button alerts contacts. If the user doesn’t confirm safety within that time, a high-alert with location is sent out.

The app also detects red alert zones with past incidents and notifies users and their contacts. A built-in transportation feature allows users to book verified vehicles; if they don’t arrive in 10 minutes, contacts are alerted.

Additional features include a self-defense guide with video tutorials, shake-to-alert functionality, and voice-activated alerts using a customizable safe word. The design is cozy, modern, and built to provide reassurance without compromising on style or function.
